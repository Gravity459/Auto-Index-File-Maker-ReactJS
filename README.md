# Automatic `index.js` Generator for Assets and Components

## Overview

This Python script simplifies the organization of your JavaScript/React project by automatically creating `index.js` files for both the "assets" and "components" folders. These `index.js` files serve as entry points for importing assets (e.g., icons, SVGs, images) and components, making it easier to manage and import resources within your project.

## Features

- **Automatic Index Generation**: The script scans the "assets" and "components" folders and generates `index.js` files with import statements for each item found.

- **Customizable**: You can configure the script to include only specific file types (e.g., icons, SVGs, images) or exclude certain files or directories.

- **Organized Imports**: The generated `index.js` files ensure that imports are well-structured and follow best practices, making it easier to maintain your project's structure.

## Usage

1. Clone or download the repository containing the Python script.

2. Navigate to the root directory of your JavaScript/React project.

3. Open a terminal and run the script by executing the following command:
